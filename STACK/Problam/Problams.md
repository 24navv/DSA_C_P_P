# Given a stack S, the task is to copy the content of the given stack S to another stack T maintaining the same order.

# Design a dynamic stack using arrays that supports getMin() in O(1) time and O(1) extra space

# Convert given Binary string S to all 1s by changing all 0s to 1s in range [i+1, i+K] if S[i] is 1

# Reversing a Stack using two empty Stacks

# Random Acyclic Maze Generator with given Entry and Exit point
